# LOFI DRUMKIT - html, css, js

This was one of , it not, the first javascript project task we got.
It was to create a drumkit. It should get triggered by both mouseclicks and keydowns.

Since i am also a musicproducer for over 20 years i decided to make one that is related to my musicalstyle which is Lofi.

This is the first project where i actually sat down and wrote out a pseudo code in my notes on my phone over what needed to be done and how i could do it. I then went home and did it. It was a proud moment if iÂ´m totally honest.
The code was not DRY at all and there was a better way of doing it, but i did it from nothing.

I learned how to leverage DOM manipulation, work with eventListeners and also to be creative with what i had to work with.
I loaded my own samples, made it look like a lofi kit and it even has vinyl noise included.
